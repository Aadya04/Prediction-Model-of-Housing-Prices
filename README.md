# Prediction-Model-of-Housing-Prices

The dataset contains pricing data of 546 houses with 12 independent variables and furnishing status as the dependent variable. We begin the analysis with elementary EDA and move into preparing the dummy variables for string data points in specific columns. The data is then normalized and prepared for regression by random splitting into train and test sets. The regression model is run and the results are analyzed. Then, supplement regression results with VIF and the co-relation matrix. We filter out the necessary variables and refine the model to achieve an RMSE of 0.09.
